yml is potentially useless lol

compile.bash use:
bash compile.bash [1 arg: path to tex file]
For example:
bash compile.bash latex/test/hello.tex

results in hello.pdf being put into pdf/test

WARNINGS:
* Cannot guarantee successful .tex to .pdf compilation when the current directory is not the repo root
    * due to latex relative paths
* school_work is not guaranteed to have correct answers
    * no review has been done after initial submission

REMAINING TO BE IMPORTED:
