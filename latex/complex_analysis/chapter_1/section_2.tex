\section{Functions on the Complex Plane}
\subsection{Continuous Functions}
Let $f$ be a function on a set $\Omega$ of complex numbers. We say that $f$ is \textbf{continuous}
at a point $z_0\in\Omega$ if for every $\eps > 0$ there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that whenever
$z\in\Omega$ and $\abs{z - z_0} < \delta$ then $\abs{f(z) - f(z_0)} < \eps$. Equivalently, we can 
say for every sequence $\cbrac{z_1, z_2, \hdots}\subset \Omega$ such that $\lim z_n = z_0$, then
$\lim f(z_n) = f(z_0)$. The function $f$ is continuous on $\Omega$ if it is continuous at every
point in $\Omega$. Sums and products of continuous functions are also continuous.

It is worth noting that the function $f$ of the complex argument $z = x + iy$ is continuous if and
only if it is continuous viewed as a function of the two real variables $x, y$.

By the triangle inequality, we see that if $f$ is continuous, then the real-valued function defined
by $z\to\abs{f(z)}$ is continuous. We say that $f$ attains a \textbf{maximum} at a point $z_0\in\Omega$
if
$$\abs{f(z)} \leq \abs{f(z_0)}\text{ for all }z\in\Omega,$$
with the inequality reversed for the definition of a \textbf{minimum}.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:main}
    A continuous function on a compact set $\Omega$ attains a maximum and minimum on $\Omega$.
\end{theorem}


\subsection{Holomorphic Functions}
Let $\Omega\subset\C$ be open and $f$ a complex-valued function on $\Omega$. The function $f$ is
\textbf{holomorphic at the point} $z_0\in\Omega$ if
$$\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(z_0 + h) - f(z_0)}{h}$$
converges. Here $h\in\C$ and $h\neq 0$ with $z_0 + h\in\Omega$, so that the quotient is well-defined.
The limit of the quotient, when it exists, is denoted by $f'(z_0)$ and is called the \textbf{derivative
of} $f$ \textbf{at} $z_0$:
$$f'(z_0) = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(z_0 + h) - f(z_0)}{h}.$$
Take note that $h$ is complex and can approach $0$ from any direction.

The function $f$ is \textbf{holomorphic on} $\Omega$ if it is holomorphic at every point of $\Omega$.
If $C$ is a closed subset of $\C$, we say that $f$ is \textbf{holomorphic on} $C$ if $f$ is holomorphic
in some open set containing $C$. If $f$ is holomorphic on $\C$, we say that $f$ is \textbf{entire}.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:main}
    If $f$ and $g$ are holomorphic in $\Omega$, then:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $f + g$ is holomorphic in $\Omega$ and $(f + g)' = f' + g'$.

        \item $fg$ is holomorphic in $\Omega$ and $(fg)' = f'g + fg'$.

        \item If $g(z_0) \neq 0$, then $f/g$ is holomorphic at $z_0$ and
        $$(f/g)' = \frac{gf' - fg'}{g^2}.$$
    \end{itemize}

    Moreover, if $f: \Omega\to U$ and $g: U\to\C$ are holomorphic, then the chain rule holds;
    $$(g\circ f)'(z) = g'(f(z))f'(z) \text{ for all } z\in\Omega.$$
\end{proposition}
\yesqed


\subsection*{Complex-Valued Functions as Mappings}
Recall that a fuction $F(x, y) = (u(x, y), v(x, y))$ is said to be differentiable at a point $P_0 = (x_0, y_0)$ if there exists a linear
transformation $J: \R^2\to\R^2$ such that
$$\frac{\abs{F(P_0 + H) - F(P_0) - J(H)}}{\abs{H}} \to 0 \text{ as } \abs{H}\to 0, H\in\R^2$$
Equivalently we can write
$$F(P_0 + H) - F(P_0) = J(H) + \abs{H}\Psi(H),$$
with $\abs{\Psi(H)} \to 0$ as $H \to 0$. The linear transformation $J$ is unique and is called the derivative of $F$ at $P_0$. If $F$ is
differentiable, the partial derivatives of $u$ and $v$ exist and $J$ is described with the standard basis in $\R^2$ by the Jacobian of $F$
$$J = J_F(x, y) = 
\paren{\begin{matrix}
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \\
    \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}
\end{matrix}}.$$

With complex-differentiation, the derivative is a complex number $f'(z_0)$, and with the reals it is a matrix. However, there is a relation
to be found involving the partials of $u$ and $v$.

Given the following equations
\begin{equation}
    \frac{f(z_0 + h) - f(z_0)}{h}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    f(z_0 + h) - f(z_0) - ah = h\psi(h)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\abs{F(P_0 + H) - F(P_0) - J(H)}}{\abs{H}} \to 0 \text{ as } \abs{H\to 0}
\end{equation}
consider the limit when $h$ is real. That is, $h = h_1 + ih_2$ with $h_2 = 0$. Then if we write $z = x + iy$, $z_0 = x_0 + iy_0$, and $f(z) = f(x, y)$,
we find that
\begin{align*}
    f'(z_0) &= \lim_{h_1\to 0} \frac{f(x + h_1, y_0) - f(x_0, y_0)}{h_1} \\
    &= \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(z_0).
\end{align*}
Now taking $h$ to be purely imaginary with $h = ih_2$, a similar argument shows that
\begin{align*}
    f'(z_0) &= \lim_{h_2\to 0}\frac{f(x_0, y_0 + h_2) - f(x_0, y_0)}{ih_2} \\
    &= \frac{1}{i} \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(z_0).
\end{align*}

Therefore, if $f$ is holomorphic, we have shown that 
$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{1}{i}\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}.$$
Writing $f = u + iv$ after seperating real and imaginary parts as well as using $1 / i = -i$, we find that the partials of $u$ and $v$ exist,
and they satisfy the following relations:
$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \text{ and } \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}.$$
These are the \textbf{Cauchy-Riemann equations}. We can take this further and define two differential operators:
$$\frac{\partial}{\partial z} = \frac{1}{2}\paren{\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{i}\frac{\partial}{\partial y}} 
\text{ and } 
\frac{\partial}{\partial \overline{z}} = \frac{1}{2}\paren{\frac{\partial}{\partial x} - \frac{1}{i}\frac{\partial}{\partial y}}.$$

\noqed
\begin{proposition}\label{prop:main}
    If $f$ is holomorphic at $z_0$, then
    $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial \overline{z}} = 0 \text{ and } 
    f'(z_0) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}(z_0) = 2\frac{\partial u}{\partial z}(z_0).$$
    Also, if we write $F(x, y) = f(z)$, then $F$ is differentiable in the sense of real variables, and
    $$\det{J_F}(x_0, y_0) = \abs{f'(z_0)}^2.$$
\end{proposition}
\yesqed
\begin{proof}
    Taking real and imaginary parts, it is easy to see the Cauchy-Riemann equations are equivalent to $\partial f / \partial \overline{z} = 0$.
    By our earlier observation
    \begin{align*}
        f'(z_0) &= \frac{1}{2}\paren{\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(z_0) + \frac{1}{i}\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(z_0)} \\
        &= \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}(z_0)
    \end{align*}
    and the Cauchy-Riemann equations give $\partial f / \partial z = 2\partial u / \partial z$. To prove that $F$ is differentiable,
    it suffices to show that if $H = (h_1, h_2)$ and $h = h_1 + ih_2$, then the Cauchy-Riemann equations imply
    $$J_F(x_0, y_0)(H) = \paren{\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} - i\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}}(h_1 + ih_2) = f'(z_0)h,$$
    where we have identified a complex number with the pair of real and imaginary parts. Another application of the Cauchy-Riemann equations
    give
    $$\det{J_F}(x_0, y_0) = \frac{\partial u}{\partial }\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}
    = \paren{\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}}^2 + \paren{\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}}^2 = \abs{2\frac{\partial u}{\partial z}}^2 = |f'(z_0)|^2.$$
\end{proof}

\noqed
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:main}
    Suppose $f = u + iv$ is a complex-valued function defined on an open set $\Omega$. If $u$ and $v$ are continuously differentiable 
    and satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations on $\Omega$, then $f$ is holomorphic on $\Omega$ and $f'(z) = \partial f / \partial z$.
\end{theorem}
\yesqed
\begin{proof}
    Write 
    $$u(x + h_1, y + h_2) - u(x, y) = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}h_1 + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}h_2 + |h|\psi_1(h)$$
    and
    $$v(x + h_1, y + h_2) - v(x, y) = \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}h_1 + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}h_2 + |h|\psi_2(h),$$
    where $\psi_j (h)\to 0$ (for $j = 1,2$) as $|h|\to 0$ and $h = h_1 + ih_2$. Using the Cauchy-Riemann equations, we find that
    $$f(z + h) - f(z) = \paren{\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} - i\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}}(h_1 + ih_2) + |h|\psi(h),$$
    where $\psi(h) = \psi_1(h) + \psi_2(h)\to 0$ as $|h|\to 0$. Therefore $f$ is holomorphic and 
    $$f'(z) = 2\frac{\partial u}{\partial z} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}.$$
\end{proof}
